# Inheritance-in-Python-OOP
A parent class is created and extended it to sub class 

### ðŸš˜ Inheritance: ElectricCar Class

I created a `Car` class with basic attributes and extended it into an `ElectricCar` subclass by adding a new attribute: `battery_capacity`.

Key Learnings:
- Use of `super().__init__()` to call the base constructor
- Adding new methods and attributes in a subclass
- Object-oriented principles like inheritance and reuse

ðŸ”‹ Object used: `ElectricCar("MG", "Windsor EV Essence Pro", 2025, "Gold", "Electricity", "38 kWh")`
